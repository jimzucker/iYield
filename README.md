**Know what a dividend stock or ETF actually pays you — after taxes, and after the share price moves.**

TrueYield is a mobile app that takes a ticker and your marginal tax rates and answers one question honestly: *for the last 12 months, what was my real yield?* A headline yield of "15%" can quietly become single digits once you account for the price you'd actually reinvest at, the taxes you'd actually owe, and the change in the share price itself. TrueYield shows you all of it, side by side, in one screen.

## Why TrueYield

The "yield" number you see on most finance sites is the simplest possible calculation: trailing distributions divided by today's price. It's a useful headline, but it hides three things that decide whether an investment actually paid off:

- **Reinvestment price.** If you reinvest each distribution (DRIP), you buy at the price *on the day it was paid* — not today's price. For volatile high-yield ETFs, that materially changes your effective yield.
- **Taxes.** Distributions are income. Your real take-home depends on your federal, state, and local marginal rates.
- **The share price.** A 15% yield means little if the share price fell 16% over the same year. Income and price change together are your **total return** — often the only number that matters.

TrueYield simulates a full year of **broker DRIP** reinvestment, taxes only the portion of distributions that is actually taxable income (accounting for **return of capital**), and reports your **total return after tax** alongside the advertised and after-tax yields — so you can see how much the headline number leaves out.

## How to use it

1. **Enter a ticker** (e.g. `YMAG`, `SCHD`, `JEPI`).
2. **Enter your marginal tax rates** — federal, state, and local, as whole percentages (local defaults to `0`).
3. **Enter the Return of capital %** — the share of distributions classified as return of capital, which isn't taxed this year (it lowers your cost basis instead). Defaults to `71`, a typical figure for option-income ETFs.
4. **Tap Calculate.**

The result card leads with **Total return after tax** — your income plus the change in share price, net of this year's tax, measured against what one share cost a year ago. Directly beneath it are the three components that sum to it: **income (taxable)**, **unrealized gain/loss**, and **tax this year**. Then two yields on today's price: the **Advertised yield** (the headline) and the **After-tax yield**. A reference grid shows the position economics underneath (shares after DRIP, present value, and cost basis).

Switch to the **Distributions** and **Prices** tabs to see the exact payouts and the daily closes the calculation is built on. Your inputs are saved locally, so they're already filled in next time you open the app.

If a ticker paid no distributions in the last 12 months, it's flagged **"Does not qualify"** and the card shows just the current price.

## How the numbers work

TrueYield models one share bought ~12 months ago at `start_price`, with every distribution reinvested through a **broker DRIP** at the share price on its pay date. Only the taxable portion of distributions — `income = total × (1 − ROC%)` — is taxed this year at your combined marginal rate; the return-of-capital portion isn't taxed now but lowers your cost basis. The headline figures:

| Figure | What it means | How it's calculated |
|---|---|---|
| **Advertised yield** | The headline number most sites quote. | `total distributions / current_price` |
| **After-tax yield** | What you actually keep, after this year's tax. | `(total distributions − tax) / current_price` |
| **Total return after tax** | The bottom line: income *and* price change, net of tax, on your original cost. | `(NAV − tax − start_price) / start_price` |

…where `NAV = shares_after_DRIP × current_price` and `tax = combined_rate × taxable income`. The card also surfaces the **cost basis** (`start_price + reinvested income`) and the resulting **unrealized gain/loss** (`NAV − cost basis`), which is taxed as capital gains only when you sell.

## Data and privacy

TrueYield runs entirely on your device. There is no account, no API key, and no backend server. When you tap Calculate, it makes a single HTTPS request to Yahoo Finance's public chart endpoint to fetch the trailing 12 months of **daily** prices and distributions for your ticker — nothing else leaves your device, and nothing is logged or transmitted anywhere else.

See [PRIVACY.md](./PRIVACY.md) for the full policy.

## Important notes

- **Not investment advice.** TrueYield is an analysis tool. The numbers are historical (trailing 12 months) and are not a forecast.
- **US tax model.** Calculations apply a single combined marginal rate (federal + state + local) to the **taxable** portion of distributions. The return-of-capital portion is treated as a cost-basis reduction (its tax is deferred to sale as capital gains), not taxed in-year. Qualified-dividend rates are not modeled — set the rates to match your situation.
- **Daily resolution.** Prices and the DRIP reinvestment use daily closes over a one-year window, so weekly and monthly payers are both handled without bucketing.
- **Unofficial data source.** Data comes from Yahoo Finance's public, unofficial endpoint, which can change or rate-limit without notice. TrueYield is not affiliated with Yahoo.

## Running it

TrueYield is a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) app and runs on iOS and Android (the project also includes desktop and web targets). To build and run from source:

```sh
flutter pub get
flutter run -d <device-id>
```

Dependencies are deliberately minimal: `http` for the single network call and `shared_preferences` for saving your inputs. No state-management library — plain `setState`.

## Development

The calculation logic lives in a pure, dependency-free `YieldMath` class (no Flutter, no network, no clock), which makes it straightforward to test. Three checks — formatting, static analysis, and the test suite — run in three places, all kept in sync:

```sh
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

- **CI** — [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs all three on every push to `main` and every pull request.
- **Pre-commit hook** — enable once per checkout so `git commit` runs the same gate locally:

  ```sh
  git config core.hooksPath .githooks
  ```

The test suite covers the broker-DRIP / return-of-capital math (flat-price baseline, the ROC income split, price-drop and price-rise total return, distribution ordering, and daily-bar YMAG/TQQQ fixtures verified against the Python reference in [`tools/yield_ref.py`](./tools/yield_ref.py)), the Yahoo response parser and each of its error branches, the no-distribution and null-price edge cases, the web-only CORS-proxy routing (native targets always call Yahoo directly), and the app's tab rendering, input validation (including the return-of-capital range), and saved-input restoration.
